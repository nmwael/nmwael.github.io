# Simplest way of getting clean commits

This is for contributing when forking projects.
It allows me todo multiple work in a simple branch, then cherry pick files with different feature purpose and do PR from those without needing to split up work while retaining a clean git log when doing the PR back to the forked project.

```d2 sketch pad=50
direction: right

Fork

PR.A
PR.B
Branch

Fork -> Branch.A
Branch.A <-> Branch.A: lots of messy commits {style.animated: true}
Branch.A -> Branch.B: Sqash cherry picked files from A to B
Branch.B -> PR.A: clean single commit
Branch.A -> Branch.C: Sqash wanted files from A to PR.B
Branch.C -> PR.B: clean single commit

PR.A -> Fork origin
PR.B -> Fork origin
```

Commands needed

```
git merge --squash other-branch
git commit
git rebase -i HEAD~<number_of_commits> 
```
